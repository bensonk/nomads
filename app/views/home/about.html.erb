    <h2> The Trip </h2>
  </div>
  <p>
  The plan is to ride our bike all around the United States; carry our own gear, camp out and 
  see as much of our country as we can manage. Starting in Port Angeles, WA we will ride south 
  perhaps as far as San Diego, CA. Then we will head east to Florida and stay in Florida for most 
  of the winter. We hope to hitch a ride on a boat out into the Bahamas for some of this time. 
  Once the east coast is warm enough to ride (~March) we will start heading north as far as New York. 
  Then we will go west back toward Washington. It is basically a big square and with all of the small 
  side trips we have planned it will end up being at least 10,000 miles (16,000 km).

  <p> 
  I studied math and physics at WWU in Bellingham, WA. Then ended up applying my knowledge at the 
  Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle for a year and a half. The ISB was fantastic and I actually
  really enjoyed living in Seattle. I've been planning an extended cycling tour for several years and it 
  is amazing to finally be doing and to have someone to do it with.
